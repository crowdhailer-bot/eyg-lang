# EYG Spec

Specification of the EYG language.
Includes test suites for features to encourage valid alternative implementations.

## Why "no syntax"

The intermediate representaion of EYG is the stable interface for the language.
There is "no syntax" for the EYG language. This differs from most languages where the surface syntax is the public interface and IR/AST is an implementation detail that is not guaranteed to be stable.

Tools that build on EYG do not have to reimplement parsing before they can work with programs as a structural level.

- Want your own syntax? Build a parser to target the IR and use the rest of the EYG tooling to run it. 
- Need a new runtime? Use the EYG editor and build your own interpreter or compiler.
- Fancy your own type system? Write your own and keep the editor and runtimes.

## Intermediate Representation(IR) in JSON

This section describes the JSON structure of a stored EYG program.
Tests for encoding, decoding and hashing are in [ir_suite.json](./ir_suite.json)

**NOTE:** EYG does not have an official syntax, instead the IR is the front-end for the language tooling.

All valid programs have a single root expression.

The type of each node is identified by a value under the `"0"` key.
Nodes then have additional fields dependent on the type of the node.

*To keep the size of JSON documents small(ish) single letter codes are used when possible.*

All fields specified for a node are required.
There are no optional fields.
To represent an incomplete program use the `vacant` node, which is a valid expression node for hole in the program.

IR's are recursive structures, where a node has child nodes is indicated with the `expression` value.

`label` represent variables, record fields, union variants builtin identifiers and effect identifiers.
The only requirement on label string is that they are nonempty and contain no whitespace charachacters.

The IR structure is a valid [dag-json](https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-json/) structure.
Bytes are encoded according to the DAG JSON Spec. 
References are encoded as Content IDentifiers (CIDs).

```js
// variable
{"0": "v", "l": label}
// lambda(label, body)
{"0": "f", "l": label, "b": expression}
// apply(function, argument)
{"0": "a", "f": expression, "a": expression}
// let(label, value, then)
{"0": "a", "l": label, "v": expression, "t": expression}
// b already taken when adding binary
// binary(value)
{"0": "x", "v": bytes}
// integer(value)
{"0": "i", "v": integer}
// string(value)
{"0": "s", "v": string}
// tail
{"0": "ta"}
// cons
{"0": "c"}
// vacant(comment)
{"0": "z", "c": string}
// empty
{"0": "u"}

// select(label)
{"0": "g", "l": label}

{"0": "q0"}
// fact constructor: value -> Table(Relation(value))
{"0": "qf", "l": label}
// lazy rule constructor: (Table(rows) -> Table(rows)) -> Table(rows)
{"0": "qr"}
// table combination: Table(rows) -> Table(rows) -> Table(rows)
{"0": "qm"}
// resolve: Table(Relation(value), rows) -> List(value)
{"0": "qs", "l": label}
// match rows of a relation by key: Table(Relation(row), rows) -> key -> (row -> Table(rows)) -> Table(rows)
{"0": "qa", "l": label, "k": [field]}
// reference(identifier)
{"0": "#", "l": cid}
// release(project,release,identifer)
{"0": "#", "p": string, "r": integer, "l": cid}
```

## Builtins

Query operations are atoms applied with ordinary `apply` nodes. A rule stores a
pure function over a table of facts. Resolution starts with all input facts,
calls every rule with the same snapshot, unions the returned facts, and repeats
until no new facts appear. Equality gives set semantics. Rule functions must
return facts, and effects cannot escape a rule to its caller or host runtime.
The text parser lowers each relation clause to a `qa` match whose key holds
the fields already bound, so a runtime can use an index, and other pattern
constraints to pure equality tests. This keeps rule expressions available to
tree traversal, sharing, and closure capture without a second expression AST.

Tables contain a row of named relations; table combination unifies these rows.
The empty table and each fact have an open relation row so independent tables
can be combined. An absent relation resolves to an empty list. Recursive rules
with value-generating expressions need a finite bound to reach a fixed point.

Builtins must behave the same way for all implementations.
There is a test suite available in this repo that for checking the behaviour of all builtins.

The set of builtins is as small as possible so consistency accross implementations is achievable.
Builtins should not be considered the EYG standard library.
A larger library of functionality is maintained and available under the `@standard` package.

Functionality like inspecting terms should be implemented as effects.
This allows implementations of the `Debug` effect to differ.
Any inconsistency in result is completly tracked in the behaviour of the Debug effect.

Some builtins create new records/unions, i.e. `int_compare` or `list_pop`
There is also a `fix` builtin that introduces recursion.
This means there are no guarantees about memory usage of a general EYG program.

It is possible to track use of builtins if you want these gurantees.
Both `fix` and recursive queries can express nonterminating computations.
It is a non-goal of the eyg libraries to support all these usecases.
However if you have a need for them please reach out.
