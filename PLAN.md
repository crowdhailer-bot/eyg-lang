# Implement query literals into EYG

This is an example of writing query literals in an EYG program

```eyg
let is_less_than_10 = (n) -> {
    match !int_compare(n, 10) {
        Lt(_) -> { True({}) }
        | (_) -> { False({}) }
    }
}

let view = @{
    rule Reachable({from, to, n: 1}) {
        var from
        var to
        Edge({from, to})
    }
    rule Reachable({from, to, n: !int_add(n, 1)}) {
        var from
        var to
        var n
        var z
        Edge({from, to: z}),
        Reachable({from: z, to, n}),
        is_less_than_10(n)
    }
}

let db = @{
    fact Edge({from: "A", to: "B"}),
    fact Edge({from: "B", to: "C"})
}

let out = resolve Out @{
    view,
    db,
    rule Out({to, length}) {
        var to
        var length
        Reachable({from: "A", to, n: length})
    }
}
out
// [{to: "B", length: 1}, {to: "C", length: 2}]
```

- The `@` construct defines a `Table` type. The `Table` type wraps a row type the same as a `Record` or `Union`
- The `db` variable has type `Table(Edge({from: String, to: String}))`
- The `view` variable has type `Table(Reachable({from: a, to: b, n: Integer}), Edge({from: a, to: b}))
    - Note that this table is parameterised over the type of the `from` and `to` fields. EYG analysis will unify this using the same row algorithm as other components in the language
- The keyword `rule` defines a single rule it's return type is `Table` 
- The var keyword is needed to define an unbound variable. If no var is used then a variable in a match is assumed to be a literal match with a variable in the parent scope
- The keyword `fact` defines a single fact it's return type is `Table`
- Expressions in rule heads can use variables from the body and are pure EYG expressions, the type checker will check these are pure.
- Expressions in the body of a rule must be uppername labels for a pattern, or an expression that resolves to True({}) | False({})
- Any pure expression, including packages and builtins can be used in the table constructor
- A table block is built up from a list of tables. The `out` variable has a type that has unified all of the tables within it.
- Tables are lazy and the `resolve` pulls out the records of a type.


Tasks
- [x] Implement parsing for query literals
- [x] Implement a datalog engine that will calculate and resolve queries and facts.
- [x] Create an example of writing rules in a policy for overlay based on facts in a DB
    - [x] A simple rule will be requests must be get
    - [x] Create a rule that only allows files to be writen under the users home directory
    - [x] Write a meta rule that states users can only create rules with read or write permissions.
    - Examples: `eyg_packages/authorization/overlay.eyg` and `admission.eyg`;
      runnable CLI config: `examples/authorization/overlay.eyg`. Path checks are
      lexical; the documented host boundary must prevent symlink/mount escapes.
- [x] Implement a to SQL function that will turn a table into a SQL query.
    - [x] Show that this also builds a client adater for the imperative part of the program that implicitly decodes the query
    - [x] Record a video of this working against a SQLite database
        - Accessing the DB is probably via an effect i.e. `let db = perform DB({})` In this environment the return type of that will be a table with internal row type matching the rows in the database
    - `eyg/compiler/sql.to_sql` emits a SQLite program and a generated Node
      client with an inferred decoder/declaration. The imperative host owns the
      connection; no new language effect. `guides/sqlite.md` documents source
      schemas, snapshot rounds, supported values, and execution limits.
      `examples/sqlite/demo.webm` records live queries, updates, and revocation.
- [x] review this work against the flix programing language what queries can it represent that we cannot
- [x] review this work against crepe a Rust project
    - `guides/query_comparison.md` cites primary documentation and distinguishes
      query expressibility from algorithms possible in the host language.
- [x] Write a tutorial explaining how to write rules for authorization using EYG and it's query literals, including
    - role based access control
    - relation based access control
    - delegation
    - attenuated delegation
    - providence tracking
    - Full enterprise rules for multiple company departments with multiple team members and projects working wil multiple agents and long running tasks. Each team has it's own rules on when it can create or not an automation or agent.
- [x] Review the tutorial make sure every chapter has examples and that they work.
    - `guides/authorization.md`: CLI tests type-check and execute all nine blocks;
      eleven EYG test groups cover permission, denial, expiry, and revocation.
- [x] Make sure syntax highlighting works and the tutorial looks good.
    - Shared TextMate grammar covers query syntax; website tests verify rendered
      code and links. Chromium review at 1280px and 390px found no page overflow.
- [x] Write a presentation explaining why EYG is so good for knowing what your agents are up to
    - The presenation should explain why this appoach is better than https://www.biscuitsec.org/
    - `presentations/agent-oversight.html`: 12 slides with notes, source links,
      keyboard controls, and print styles. The comparison scopes EYG's advantage
      to owning the executor and preserves Biscuit's signed-token advantages.
      Reviewed in Chromium on desktop/mobile; navigation and PDF export checked.

## Implementation and verification work

- [x] Extend the IR and its codecs with query operations; preserve sharing,
      capture, compilation, and structural editing of query programs.
- [x] Add row-polymorphic `Table` inference and reject effectful rule heads and
      predicates, unsafe variables, and inconsistent relation schemas.
- [x] Test lazy composition, joins, repeated variables, lexical constants,
      recursion, duplicate elimination, and termination/resource limits.
      The interpreter's cooperative step-budget API suspends unbounded queries
      and predicates; ordinary entry points stay unbounded. Syntax documentation
      distinguishes transition budgets from host-enforced time/memory limits.
- [x] Wire repository packages to the local language implementation so CLI and
      integration tests exercise this branch rather than published packages.
- [x] Verify interpreter/compiler parity and run the repository's Gleam and EYG
      suites, plus executable tutorial and SQLite examples.
      The CONTRIBUTING matrix passes: 15 JavaScript and 9 Erlang packages.
      Also checked loam, overlay, overlay_web, and pal on JavaScript, and all
      67 hub integration tests against an isolated migrated PostgreSQL database.
      The root EYG suite passes 158 tests; all 133 shared specification fixtures
      pass in the compiler; separate regressions check escaped query effects.
      The generated SQLite client and live demo assertions pass.
- [x] Audit every original deliverable, including the recorded SQLite demo and
      rendered tutorial/presentation; leave a concise history on `bot/datalog`.
      Website build succeeds; final Chromium checks cover both guides and all
      12 slides at desktop/mobile widths. The SQLite video records live database
      updates and revocation. History groups core queries/budgets, authorization,
      comparison/presentation, and SQLite into four implementation commits.
- [x] Make multi-relation `Table` types readable in diagnostics and test the
      displayed type for a polymorphic view.
